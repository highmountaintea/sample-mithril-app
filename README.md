**sample-mithril-app** is a small sample mithril.js app, pre-configured with webpack. It serves as a template for starting a new mithril.js project.


## Purpose

I created this project to build a robust and versatile mithril.js template that can be cloned when we start a new mithril.js project. It is set up with webpack and webpack-dev-server to streamline development and build. It is directly used by [`create-mithril-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-mithril-app) to create new projects.


## Usage

Clone this project [(here)](https://github.com/highmountaintea/sample-mithril-app.git) and use it as a starting point for your new mithril.js app. Or use [`create-mithril-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-mithril-app) to streamline this cloning process.


## Development

As this template is improved, it will benefit all the future projects based on it.
